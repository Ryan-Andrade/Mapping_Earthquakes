# Mapping_Earthquakes
 This project is a showcase of my skill in calling API's with JavaScript.
The webpage I've created is a map of Earthquake data from the past 7 days 
called from a GeoJSON API provided by the United States Geological Survey.
The map is called from a MapBox API, and the layering is provided by
Leaflet. The Earthquake's are displayed by circles in which their size 
correlates to the magnitude of the Earthquake. Additionally each circle
includes popup information which relays the location and exact magnitude.
